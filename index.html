        <p>How do you know how to use an operating system? How do you know how to use software?</p>
        <p>We can see patterns in interactions, systems and commands we use to interact with software on popular operating systems (and their desktop environments) that were established early on by their creators.</p>
        <p>Think of various versions of Windows, Linux and OSX. Think of how we have command line interactions, where we need to memorize frequently used commands in order to become skillful at using software.</p>

        <p>These decisions were created by those with certain mental models that they acquired through a combination of influencing factors such as: education, environment, opportunity, technology and genetics.</p>

      <article id="different">
        <p>We do not have the same mental models because we do not have the exact combinaton of factors that standardize our way of learning and understanding. As a result, some of us have stronger skills in spatial recognition, numerical processes, lexical systems or even social interactions. The order of information and environment (or lack thereof) is heavily based in inequality, timing and network.</p>
        <p>If minds work and learn differently, then why not look at revisiting the design and interactions of software?</p>
        <p>Shouldn't we look at how the body and mind interacts in its environment with the technology that we use?</p>
        <p>Shouldn't that technology and the way we provide commands to it be changed to fit our mental models?</p>

        <p>Colorspace is a way of interacting in a desktop environment that relies on particular color sequences as a form of command-line operations. These commands current load two applications - a drawing app and a camera app.</p>
