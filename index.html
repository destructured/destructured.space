        <p>How do you know how to use an operating system? How do you know how to use software?</p>
        <p>We can see patterns in interactions, systems and commands we use to interact with software on popular operating systems (and their desktop environments) that were established early on by their creators.</p>
        <p>Think of various versions of Windows, Linux and OSX. Think of how we have command line interactions, where we need to memorize frequently used commands in our mind in order to become skillful at using software.</p>

        <p>These decisions were created by people with certain mental models that they acquired through a combination of influencing factors such as: education, environment, opportunity, technology and genetics.</p>

      <article id="different">
        <p>People do not acquire information necessarily in the same combination of influencing factors. Some have stronger skills in spatial recognition, numerical processes, lexical systems and even social interactions. The order of information and environment (or lack thereof) is heavily based in inequality, timing and network.</p>
        <p>If minds work and learn differently, then why not look at revisiting the design and interactions of software?</p>
        <p>Shouldn't we look at how the body and mind interacts in its environment with the technology that we use?</p>
        <p>Shouldn't that technology and the way we provide commands to it be changed to fit our mental models?</p>

        <p>Colorspace is a way of looking at a desktop environment that only contains commands through a color sequence and lacks keyboard output.</p>
